Rocketbot: The Cinematic Tech Manifest (Master Guidelines)
1. Brand Essence: "The Silicon Valley Vision"
Vibe: Premium, Executive-grade, and Futuristic.
The Goal: To make Rocketbot look like a world-class technology leader. The site shouldn't feel like a corporate portal; it should feel like an immersive, cinematic experience.
Atmosphere: "Deep Space Journey." High contrast, infinite depth, and glowing technical artifacts.
2. Visual Identity & Color System
Strict adherence to the Rocketbot Palette is non-negotiable. Use CSS variables defined in 
globals.css
.

Foundation: Dark-mode is the default. Background: #0A0A0F (--background).
Primary Action: Rocket Red (#BC0017). Used for branding, CTO calls, and critical progress indicators.
Technical Accents (The Neons):
Cyan (#00D4FF): Strategy, Expansion, & Global reach.
Magenta (#FF00F5): Innovation, Creative Suite, & Dev environments.
Lime (#00FF88): Growth, AI, & Future capabilities.
Glassmorphism: Use semi-transparent backgrounds (5-8% opacity) with high-intensity blur (backdrop-blur-3xl) to create the "Floating UI" feel.
3. Typography: "High-Impact Modernism"
Headlines: Bold, black weight (font-black), tight tracking (tracking-tighter), and minimal line height (leading-none). Headlines should be "Oversized" to command attention.
Metadata: Small, monospaced fonts for technical details.
Contrast: Stark difference between massive headers and lightweight, elegant body text.
4. The Animation Language: "Cinematic Motion"
This is the "Secret Sauce" of the Rocketbot UI.

Scroll-Driven Narrative (Scrollytelling): Content is revealed through scrolling. Use "Scenes" that take up the full viewport.
Parallax & Depth: Utilize the Z-axis. Backgrounds (
ConnectedNetwork
) move slower than foregrounds. Elements should scale or rotate in 3D space as you scroll.
Entrance Physics:
Avoid generic "Ease-In-Out." Use Spring Physics for a snappier, more organic feel (Stiffness ~100, Damping ~30).
Use "Cascading" reveals (stagger children animations) so the UI "builds itself" as the user arrives.
Dynamic Backgrounds: The 
ConnectedNetwork
 particle system must feel alive, reacting to mouse movement or scroll velocity, creating a sense of "Neural Activity."
5. Core Building Blocks (The Atoms)
GlassCard: The standard container. It must feel like a floating piece of glass.
ConnectedNetwork
: The fabric of the space-theme. Use it as a persistent layer to connect different sections of the site.
Hero Sections: Always centered, high-impact typography with a subtle glow (text-shadow) and a primary call-to-action that pulses.
6. Implementation Standards (The Code)
Next.js First: Modular, component-based architecture using the App Router.
Framer Motion Mastery: Use useScroll, useTransform, and useInView.
Rule: Never call Motion hooks inside loops. Extract to child components.
Hydration Control: Always wrap client-side specific animations in a mounted check to prevent SSR/Hydration mismatches.
Performance: Use pointer-events: none on large decorative overlays to ensure the scroll remains smooth and natural.
7. Tone & Copy (Narrative Style)
Language: Spanish (LATAM/Neutral).
Voice: Empowering, Visionary, and Technical. Use words like "Democratización," "Evolución," "Singularidad," and "Escalabilidad."
Structure: Start with a big problem or vision (The Intro), show the journey/tools (The Body), and end with the future impact (The AI Singularity).
